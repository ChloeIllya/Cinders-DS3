# Changelog
#------------------------------
# General
- Split the world altering Curses into a separate menu, now called Marks.
- Marks may be global or unique to specific levels. If they are unique to a specific level, the soul absorption bonus is only active whilst in that level.
- Curse of Attraction is now called Mark of Sanguis.
- Added Mark of Canis: adds dogs to the High Wall of Lothric. Disables most of the regular enemies.

# Trial
- Reduced enemy damage to *1.25 (was *2).
- Made the rocky outcrops in the arena unbreakable whilst the Trial is active, so they can provide cover.

# NPCs
- Added Magnum Ursus: this NPC hosts the Mark system and is used to toggle them. Found in Firelink Shrine.

# Enemies
- Red Lizzies can now be killed and will drop either 1 Twinkling Titanite or 1 Titanite Scale. However they will emit their explosion on death.

# Spells
- Added differing stamina costs to spells again.
- Changed Catalystm/Earthfall/Heavenly Thunder: now similar to Crystal Hail but with fewer but more accurate bullets. Damage per bullet is 300.
- Changed Immolation: summons fire pillars around the player that hit enemies and the player alike.
- Changed Overwhelming Power: it is now like a walkable firestorm (uses Fire Surge animation). Lasts until you stop or run out of FP. Added lingering hitbox to the lightning ground sparks.
- Changed Proof of a Pact: now uses the Fire Surge animation, spawns Silver Knight Ledo slightly in front of the player. Lasts until you stop or run out of FP.
- Increased FP cost of Dark Dance to 650.
- Added Ghostly Assault: summons a group of 5 ghostly archers that will each fire 3 times until disappearing. Dropped by the Judicator at the start of the Ringed City.

# Bugfixes
- Serpentine Orbs should now always use 5 orbs.
- Smouldering Talisman Immolate WA now matchs Immolation (but lasts 6 seconds).
- Dragonrider can no longer be parried.
- Fixed some localization bugs.
- Mimics/Sister Friede/Stray Demon now only have 50% Flick absorption, which means certain types of attacks will now do 50% damage against them (used to be 0%).
- The invader script should no longer display the invade message outside of the trigger area in odd circumstances.
