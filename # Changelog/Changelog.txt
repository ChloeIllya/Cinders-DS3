# Changelog
#------------------------------
# General
- Added a new challenge system, Marks. This is for effects that change the world, such as adding in enemies or changing objects.
- Marks may be global (all levels) or unique to specific levels. If they are unique to a specific level, the soul absorption bonus is only active whilst in that level.
- Curse of Attraction has been made into a mark: Mark of Sanguis
- Added Mark of Canis: adds dogs to the High Wall of Lothric.

# NPCs
- Added Magnum Ursus: this NPC hosts the Mark system and is used to toggle them. Found in Firelink Shrine.

# Spells
- Added differing stamina costs to spells again.
- Changed Catalystm/Earthfall/Heavenly Thunder: now similar to Crystal Hail but with fewer but more accurate bullets. Damage per bullet is 300.
- Changed Immolation: summons fire pillars around the player that hit enemies and the player alike.
- Changed Overwhelming Power: it is now like a walkable firestorm (uses Fire Surge animation). Lasts until you stop or run out of FP. Added lingering hitbox to the lightning ground sparks.

# Bugfixes
- Serpentine Orbs should now always use 5 orbs.
- Smouldering Talisman Immolate WA now matchs Immolation (but lasts 6 seconds).
- Dragonrider can no longer be parried.
- Fixed some localization bugs.
- Mimics/Sister Friede/Stray Demon now only have 50% Flick absorption, which means certain types of attacks will now do 50% damage against them (used to be 0%).
