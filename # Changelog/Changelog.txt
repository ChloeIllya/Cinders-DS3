# Maps
- The majority of the hostile NPC enemies are now invaders, and will only appear when the player is in a certain location (rather than always being present). You do not need to be embered for them to appear.
- The location of several of the NPC enemies has been moved to account for their new method of appearing.
- Reworked the layout of the Consumed King's Garden area. 
- The main part now has 2 Pus of Men near the front, then a mix of slugs and basilisks in the middle. 
- The Cathedral Knights and Lothric Priests are now in the upper back path area.
- The Mirror Knight is now at the top of the stairs that lead to the plaza before Oceiros.

# Bugfixes
- In-map warps now set your respawn near to the exit point. This will prevent oddities that occur when you die and appear back in the original map.
