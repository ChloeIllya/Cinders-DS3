# Changelog
#------------------------------
# Weapons
- Changed Gravelord Sword moveset: now has slower versions of the normal Curved Sword Light attacks, and the forward poke thrust as its heavy attacks.

# Classes
- Reduced some of the stats for the Sentinel, Bandit, Hunter and Paladin. Reduced the weapon requirements for their weapons to fit.
- Added Jester class.

# Curses
- Split the world altering Curses into a separate menu, now called Marks.
- Marks may be global or unique to specific levels. If they are unique to a specific level, the soul absorption bonus is only active whilst in that level.
- Curse of Attraction is now called Mark of Sanguis.
- Added Mark of Canis: adds dogs to the High Wall of Lothric. Disables most of the regular enemies.
- Added Mark of Piscis: adds crabs to Road of Sacrifices/Farron Keep. Disables most of the regular enemies.
- Added Curse of Simplicity: removes the passive FP regen, boosts soul gain by 5%, primordial titanite chance of 10%.
- Added Curse of Enfeeblement: reduces max HP/FP/Stamina by 50%, boosts soul gain by 10%, primordial titanite chance of 50%.

# FP
- Reduced the base FP regen to 3% per second (was 5%).

# Trial
- Reduced enemy damage to *1.25 (was *2).
- Made the rocky outcrops in the arena unbreakable whilst the Trial is active, so they can provide cover.

# NPCs
- Added Magnum Ursus: this NPC hosts the Mark system and is used to toggle them. Found in Firelink Shrine.

# Enemies
- Red Lizzies can now be killed and will drop either 1 Twinkling Titanite or 1 Titanite Scale. However they will emit their explosion on death.
- Corrupted Gundyr is now an early boss (bit stronger than Vordt).

# Spells
- Added differing stamina costs to spells again.
- Changed Catalystm/Earthfall/Heavenly Thunder: now similar to Crystal Hail but with fewer but more accurate bullets. Damage per bullet is 300.
- Changed Immolation: summons fire pillars around the player that hit enemies and the player alike.
- Changed Overwhelming Power: it is now like a walkable firestorm (uses Fire Surge animation). Lasts until you stop or run out of FP. Added lingering hitbox to the lightning ground sparks.
- Changed Proof of a Pact: now uses the Fire Surge animation, spawns Silver Knight Ledo slightly in front of the player. Lasts until you stop or run out of FP.
- Increased FP cost of Dark Dance to 650.
- Added Ghostly Assault: summons a group of 5 ghostly archers that will each fire 3 times until disappearing. Dropped by the Judicator at the start of the Ringed City.
- Reduced Soul Stream damage to 200 per tick (was 250)

# Items
- The cosmetic stones now apply the VFX to both hands.

# Map
- Changed the Titanite Chunks in the Cemetery of Ash area after Corrupted Gundyr into Titanite Shards.
- Replaced the Titanite Slab treasure in the Cemetery of Ash area with the Company of Champions treasure.

# Bugfixes
- Serpentine Orbs should now always use 5 orbs.
- Smouldering Talisman Immolate WA now matchs Immolation (but lasts 6 seconds).
- Dragonrider can no longer be parried.
- Fixed some localization bugs.
- Mimics/Sister Friede/Stray Demon now only have 50% Flick absorption, which means certain types of attacks will now do 50% damage against them (used to be 0%).
- The invader script should no longer display the invade message outside of the trigger area in odd circumstances.
- Paladin/Captain no longer have 2 extra levels.
- Added DLC flag check to the Dreg Heap/Ariandel in-map warps. The prompts will no longer appear if you lack the correct DLC.
- Changed a lot of buff WAs to no longer use the right/left hand system. This means they won't be cancelled by other buffs. The VFX will use the latest, but the effects will be present, meaning you can stack them. For example, using Warcry and the Dark Gauntlets will retain both the Curse inflict and the AR boost from Warcry, as they no longer override each other.
- Alva's set will now spawn when you kill him (was checking for the old event flag).

From Rodan:
- Mix scythe/halberd R2 into each other.
- Use valorheart R1 on other things?.
- "there's an AFAIK unused TAE that gives GS thrust R2s and the spin followup to Stomp, which would work well for Vordt's hammer, since it'd just give it thrust R2s and not the Stomp stuff" - "TAE 192 is the poke R2 and stomp spin"
- BKGA moveset on a GS

From Salva (no idea what they are about):
- From a000_029100 to a000_029610 may be a cool animation for a weapon art.
- a132_030300 and a132_030300 looks like another unused combo attack.
